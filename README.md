# 🧠 Face Detection in Images using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to detect **human faces in images** using the OpenCV library and a pre-trained **Haar Cascade classifier**. The tutorial follows a step-by-step implementation — from reading and preprocessing the image to detecting faces and visualizing results with bounding boxes.

## 🔍 What It Does

- 📷 Loads an image (`input_image.jpg`)
- 🎛️ Converts it to **grayscale** for efficient processing
- 🧠 Applies **Haar Cascade** classifier to detect human faces
- 🟩 Draws **bounding boxes** around detected faces
- 📊 Displays final output using **Matplotlib**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages with:

```bash
